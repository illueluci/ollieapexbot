# ollieapexbot
reddit bot u/ollieapexbot

change log:
Date : 6 April 2022
- now will only reply to a comment once in a submission (cannot comment twice in the same post)
- changes to subreddit list
- infinite loop so the program keeps running (rather than terminating) when there is no wifi and resumes once connected to wifi
- minor fixes

Date : 10 April 2022
- switched r/anime for r/ImSorryYagoo because this bot is banned in r/anime

Date : 12 Apr 2022
- u/illueluci (the human owner of the bot) banned from hololive subreddit, so probably the bot is too spammy according to T-chan.
- now comments in 1 out of 3 chances
- some extra printing stuff to make outputs obvious in console
- now hosted in replit (instead on an old android phone)
